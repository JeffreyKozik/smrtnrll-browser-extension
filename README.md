# smrtnrll-browser-extension
This is the code for a browser extension I created to atuomatically enroll myself in a class as soon as someone dropped it. However, I no longer use this browser extension due to ethical reasons (I believe that these type of "auto buy" bots on the internet are bad because they take away from real humans on the internet. I believe that more reform has to be done around this issue to make processes more human friendly and less bot friendly.)
